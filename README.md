# CSVFolderCreator
A program that creates folders based on folder names provided in a CSV file

## How It Works 

1. Read .csv with patientlist.py.
2. Store each entry in an array/dictionary/list. 
3. Iterate through array/dictionary/list elements.
4. For each iteration, create a folder with the element name.
