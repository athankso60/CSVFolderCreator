# CSV Folder Creator
A program that creates folders based on names provided in a CSV file

## How It Works 

1. patientlist.py reads the first row of the .csv file
2. Stores each entry name in an array/dictionary/list. 
3. Iterates through each array/dictionary/list elements and creates a folder with the entry name.

Voila!
